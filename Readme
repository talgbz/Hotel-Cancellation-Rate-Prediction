The repository is built from three components:
1. Two Colabs notebooks: EDA and Processing
2. Dataset file
3. Presentation

The proposed workflow:
1. Review project presentation.
2. Read EDA Colabs. In the workbook, we analyzed each feature and considered whether it correlates to the target, its correlation to other features, and how it will be engineered, if at all.
3. Proceed to the Process notebook. In the second notebook, we engineered the features, built, a transformer, and pipeline to deploy all relevant models (from Decision Tree to XGBoost).
   3.1 Features Engineer - Transformer- To understand the features in the transformer, please follow the relevant section of each feature in the EDA and the designated treatment:
